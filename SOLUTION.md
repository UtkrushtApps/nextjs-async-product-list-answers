# Solution Steps

1. Create a TypeScript type for Product (types/Product.ts) describing id, title, description, image, and price fields.

2. Build a reusable ProductCard component (components/ProductCard.tsx) that displays a product's image, title, short description, and price using the Product type.

3. Create the main product list page (app/products/page.tsx) that uses React client-side fetching to asynchronously load the product data from a remote JSON endpoint, manages loading and error states, and displays all ProductCard components for the products.

4. After successful products fetch, fire a non-blocking fetch to the analytics logging endpoint, ensuring no error or promise is exposed to the UI or delays rendering.

5. Implement a Next.js API route (pages/api/analytics/logPageView.ts) that accepts POST requests and simulates logging the analytics event. Respond with status 204. Add a short artificial delay for realism.

6. Ensure TypeScript typing is present throughout all code.

7. Test: Visit /products to see loading, error (if you e.g. break the endpoint), product listing, and confirm no lag from analytics logging.
